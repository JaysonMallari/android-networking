CONVERTING BYTE STREAM TO A STRING

InputSteam --> represent a stream of bytes (small chunks of data).
BufferedReader --> helps us read text froma InputStream.

notes:
	String is immutable --> it CAN'T be change once its been created.
	StringBuilder is mutable --> it CAN be change once created.
	
STRING BUILDER EXAMPLE

		StringBuilder builder =  new StringBuilder();
		builder.append("World");
		builder.deleteCharAt(3); //  delete the character "l".
		builder.append(" builder).append(".");
		
		String built = builder.toString();
